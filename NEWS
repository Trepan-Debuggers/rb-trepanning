(2.15.3) Mar 5, 2015
- Make it work on a patched Ruby 2.1.5 with runtime debugger support
  This means:
    * high-speed breakpoints, "step over" (next), and "step out" (finish)
    * when stopped in a C function, we can get parameter values
    * the source location of C functions is memory address (gdb can
      use this)
    * VM inspection, including sp, pc, instruction sequences,
      and local table
    * can change return values in Ruby code, often
    * can see/set the runtime event masks debugger triggers on
    * can get the eval string when stopped in an eval()
- Help text is rendered via redcloth/markdown
- When we are in a raise event which is non-local, indicate that
- Remove aliases 'd' and 'u' for "down" and "up"; gdb has different meanings for
  these letters

(0.1.6) Nov 25, 2012
- Make it work on Ruby 1.9.3 p327
- Incompatible change: Remove aliases 'd' and 'u' for down and up
  respectively. gdb uses 'u' and 'd' to mean something different.

(0.1.5)
- Fix bug in remote debugging not showing prompt.
- Internal RubyVM::ThreadFrame -> RubyVM::Frame

Oct 27,  2011  (0.1.4)
- Add debugger commands:
  * info iv         (is in ruby-debug)
  * info variables  (is in ruby-debug)
  * info locals as alternative to "info variables locals" (is in gdb)

- POSIX shell -x (long form: --trace) fixed

- Add disabling and enabling on display expressions

- Confirm before deleting all displays.

- Give breakpoints for files via linecache if they are syntactically
  correct Ruby files

- Change whence-file to match gdb's resolution: don't apply PATH to
  relative files.

- We should not "step" or "next" over an exception!

- Command Completion and help text improvements

- Syntax highlighting updated to support coderay 1.0

- Bugs fixed, code reorganized.

June 12, 2011  (0.1.3) Fleetwood Release
- Add debugger commands:
  * tbreak          (is in gdb)
  * info globals    (is in ruby-debug)
  * info locals     (is in gdb)
  * info source     (is in gdb)
  * info stack      (is in gdb, same as backtrace)
  * info macro      (in in gdb; remove show macro)
  * show timer      (set timer was already there)
  * pp              (is in ruby-debug)
  * set/show reload (is in ruby-debug)

- Add options from ruby-debug:
  * --cd
  * --include
  * --require
  * --debug
- fix bugs, and improve help


March 28, 2011  (0.1.2)
- Release to correct threadrame and trace package dependencies
- add "edit" command

March 15, 2011  (0.1.1)
- Revise breakpoint location parsing
  * Add: break <location> if/unless <condition>
  * Add: step until <condition>
  * VM offsets are now specified via @ rather than o or O
  * Filenames can be quoted and blanks and characters inside escaped
- Document command syntax by adding it as a new category with sub help
- More controlled parsing of method names
- Add eval (no args) and eval? to run current source line or source line
  eval? strips:
   * leading "if", "elsif", "while", "until" "return" or "case", or "unless"
   * trailing "then", "do"
- Save and restore some debugger state across a restart
- Redo command completion
- "disassemble" command: allow disassembly of specified line numbers
- GNU Readline:
  * Start GNU readline tab (command) completion.
  * Save and restore command history
  * add --readline and --no-readline options to trepanx
- Macros can return more than one command now
- help
  * "help macros" shows all macro names
  * "help aliases" shows all alias names
  * "help *" lists macros and aliases now
- start "info line"
- "info file" has/shows File::stat()'s mtime and ctime
- be able to pass --verbose to ruby to rake

Feb 1, 2011 (0.1.0)
* Add Remote debugging interface. Add options --server --port
* Add Syntax highlighting on Ruby and YARV listings and locations
* Section highlighting on some commands; italics on error if term mode
* Use ;; to allow multiple debugger commands. Document debugger command syntax
* include data files for debugging custom-require
* Numerous bug fixes and code cleanups

Dec 25, 2010 (0.0.9)
* Minor fixes. Remove some Ruby warnings

Dec 10, 2010 (0.0.8) Phel. Mad release
* Show IP in source location
* Can handle: break *method" *pos* now
* Add Kernel#debugger to be compatible with ruby-debug
* debugger { code here }  work better
* source -q silences all prompt and debugger messages
* Show instruction-sequence options on demand
* Nuke debugger set_restart => true. We now have a more reliable way to
  do this. Rubinius showing the way here.
* Improvements to the "list" command.
* Get/show eval string using rb-threadframe patch

Oct 27, 2010 (0.0.6)

* Add gdb directory command - this time for sure!
* Debugger "print" command rename to "pr" to avoid conflict with Ruby fns
 "p" and "print" (when autoeval is in effect)
* RDoc concessions in some comments
* "break" command looks up line in file better
* Numerous bugfixes and code refactoring.

Oct 8, 2010
First release under the name trepanning

* Add gdb-like "directory" command
* Add "set max list" to set number of lines to list by default.
* "break line" searches parent instruction sequences in the same file. This
  should allow more line numbers to be breakpointable.
* remap file name in custom_requre.rb
* Some small bug fixes

Sept 13, 2010

First public (gemcutter) release.
