	* processor/main.rb, processor/running.rb,
	test/functional/test-break.rb: Don't stop at same location after a
	breakpoint.

2010-05-25  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	Should'a check the functional tests...

2010-03-25  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/eventbuffer.rb: evetbuffer.rb moved to trace package.

2010-03-25  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	respect reload_on_change location.rb: use C class name hack (from
	hook arg) like we do in "where".

2010-03-23  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/location.rb, test/functional/test-finish.rb,
	test/functional/test-return.rb, test/functional/test-step.rb: 
	Distinguish return values from functions 'r=>' from return values
	from debugger evaluated expressions 'R=>'.

2010-03-21  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/command/info_subcmd/return.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/return.rb, processor/location.rb,

	processor/default.rb, processor/main.rb: Some small script (debugger
	"source" command) fixes. script.rb: Don't show debugger output if
	running a script. main.rb; Slightly better handling of blank command
	lines help.rb: don't show aliases for a commmand where help on
	subcommands were asked for.

2010-03-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/Makefile, processor/main.rb,
	test/unit/test-proc-main.rb: If a debugger command starts with !,
	for evaluation. For example s=1 would be taken as a "step" command,
	but !s=1 is an assignement to s. The leading ! is removed.

2010-03-19  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/debug.rb, processor/command/raise.rb,
	test/functional/test-raise.rb: Some "raise" command bug fixes. Some
	"debug" (recursive debug) fixes.

2010-03-19  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	pushing raise into the trace filter.

2010-03-16  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/core.rb, processor/command/raise.rb, processor/main.rb,
	test/functional/fn_helper.rb: More work on 'raise' command. Warning:
	there is a bug in my Ruby 1.9 that prevents tracing from working
	after "raise" is issued.

2010-03-16  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/core.rb, processor/command/info_subcmd/program.rb,
	processor/command/raise.rb, processor/location.rb,
	processor/main.rb, test/functional/fn_helper.rb,
	test/functional/test-delete.rb, test/functional/test-finish.rb,
	test/functional/test-step.rb: New 'raise' command which raises an
	exception in the debugged program.  The debugged-program's return
	values are now prefaced with R=> rather than =>. Hopefully this
	makes things clearer while still somewhat intuitive.

2010-03-14  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/step.rb, processor/running.rb,
	test/functional/test-next.rb: Fix a couple of small stepping bugs.

	test/functional/test-finish.rb, test/functional/test-next.rb,
	test/functional/test-step.rb, test/functional/test-trace-var.rb: 
	Show exception object when we have 'raise' event. location output
	has changed from prior commit. Track in test cases. Show exception
	object on 'raise' exception.

2010-03-13  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/command/info_subcmd/program.rb,
	processor/hook.rb, processor/location.rb, processor/main.rb: Show
	more information in location. If a call, the method name and params
	If a return the return value.

2010-03-13  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/default.rb, lib/rbdbgr.rb: Now that we have a patch for
	ruby-1.9 to fix SEGV's in eval, debug_str works. Some minor tweaks.


2010-03-13  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/irb.rb, data/irbrc, processor/command/irb.rb: irb.rb:
	Syncronize IRB's BACK_TRACE_LIMIT with the debugger's. irbrc: "file"
	for eval shouldn't contain ":" since that causes IRB to think to
	traceback are IRB bugs.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* data/irbrc: A better irb monkeypatch

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/file.rb, app/frame.rb, processor/breakpoint.rb,
	processor/command/where.rb, processor/validate.rb,
	test/unit/test-cmd-break.rb: Start to fill out breakpoints more.
	Some bugs fixed, many other roam freely.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/command/set_subcmd/btlimit.rb,
	processor/command/show_subcmd/btlimit.rb,
	processor/command/where.rb, processor/default.rb: Add set/show
	btlimit: a way to set backtrace_levels (irb's BACK_TRACE_LEVELS)

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README.textile: Minor

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/rbdbgr.rb: Add :hide_stack as an option to Debugger.debug

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/rbdbgr.rb: Debugger.debug/ger fixes: don't show stack frame
	levels below debugger method -- unless requested via :debugstack.
	Fix wrong method name.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* data/irbrc: Missed one

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* data/irbrc, processor/command/irb.rb: Regularize $rbdgr_ names in
	irb -d

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/irb.rb, app/mock.rb, processor/command/irb.rb: Less use of
	global variable $rbdbgr. Have to back off the way step/next do their
	thing. Document added irb command 'dbgr'.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/irb.rb, data/irbrc, processor/command/irb.rb,
	processor/main.rb: Add command inside irb: dbgr to issue debugger
	statements. Dry irb code a little.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/irb.rb, data/irbrc, processor/command/irb.rb: Start to get
	more info back from extend irb commands.

	processor/command/set_subcmd/trace.rb, processor/command/where.rb,
	processor/main.rb, test/functional/test-trace-var.rb: Add a
	trace_var hook and "set trace var" command.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README.textile, app/default.rb, app/frame.rb, lib/rbdbgr.rb,
	processor/command/where.rb, test/unit/test-app-frame.rb: frame.rb,
	where.rb: handle showing basename in files. Simplify interface
	README.textile: things have changed slightly

	* Rakefile: Add sudo to install when necessary

2010-03-10  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/location.rb: I'm guessing/hoping this is
	more-useful in reporting the debugger location (method
	print_location) for eval strings.

2010-03-10  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/debug.rb, processor/frame.rb: Cooler and more
	robust kind of fix to hidelevels bug.

2010-03-10  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/debug.rb: Deal thread appearing for the first
	time.

2010-03-10  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/down.rb, processor/command/info_subcmd/iseq.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/debug_subcmd/stack.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/substitute_subcmd/eval.rb,
	processor/command/up.rb, processor/frame.rb,
	test/unit/test-proc-frame.rb: frame.rb, iseq.rb: use/show SHA1's for
	instruction sequences. {up,down,frame,eval,stack}.rb: DRY code.
	eval.rb, frame.rb: allow a frame parameter to eval.

2010-03-09  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/command/list.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/substitute_subcmd/eval.rb,
	processor/frame.rb, processor/location.rb, processor/main.rb: 
	Automatic eval string remapping to a file in "list" stack and
	location listings. Manual remapping too via "set substitute eval".
	Todo possibly remove set substitute eval or change it to take a
	frame #. Work in rb-threadframe to get sha1/checksum of iseq instead
	of inspect name.

2010-03-09  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/rbdbgr.rb: Don't run .rbdbgrc or any startup file twice.

2010-03-09  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	test/functional/test-delete.rb, test/functional/test-finish.rb,
	test/functional/test-step.rb: main.rb: auto-eval output looks more
	like irb using inspect and prefaced with => print.rb: Add print
	command which uses safe-repr for output. eaval.rb: add a kind of
	eval that field hide exceptions.

2010-03-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* interface/script.rb: Small bug in script handling

2010-03-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/eval.rb, test/unit/test-proc-eval.rb: Dummy up the eval
	"filename" to something a little more informative. Eventually this
	might be pushed back into Ruby.  Start unit test for eval code.

2010-03-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* Rakefile, app/options.rb, lib/rbdbgr.rb, test/data/.gitignore,
	test/data/quit.cmd, test/data/quit.right, test/example/null.rb,
	test/integration/helper.rb, test/integration/test-quit.rb: First
	integration test - yay! options.rb: don't try to load a command file
	that isn't readable rbdbgr.rb: fix bugs in command-file handling
	integration/helper.rb Rakefile: add integration targets

2010-03-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* test/functional/fn_helper.rb, test/unit/cmd-helper.rb: tests
	should to add :nx => true now.

2010-03-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/default.rb, app/options.rb, bin/rbdbgr, lib/rbdbgr.rb,
	test/unit/test-app-options.rb: Add --nx and @settings[:nx] options.


2010-03-08  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* interface/script.rb, lib/rbdbgr.rb: rbdbgr.rb: Bug: --command used
	wrong interface. singleton methods debug and            debug_str:
	pass options to Debugger.new. Set different off on debug_s
	tr by default

2010-03-07  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* bin/rbdbgr, lib/rbdbgr.rb: --command option and
	@settings[:command] now does something. More work need to silence
	script interface output.

2010-03-07  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* app/default.rb, app/options.rb, bin/rbdbgr, lib/rbdbgr.rb,
	test/unit/test-app-options.rb: Start --command option. Not fully
	done yet.  options.rb: Fix bug in show_version().  setup_options():
	make more functional in handling of --help and --version.
	lib/rbdbgr.rb: setup options in a way that won't mess up
	DEFAULT_CMDLINE_SETTINGS. Accumulate startup-files for --command
	option.

2010-03-06  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* processor/command/debug.rb: deubg.rb: works better now. Not ideal,
	but much better.

2010-03-04  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/eval.rb: Split off evaluation routines from main.rb

2010-03-04  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/mock.rb, processor/command/debug.rb, processor/mock.rb: Add
	"debug" recursive debugging. Some of the underlying mechanism
	currently bleeds through. But better than nothing.

	* app/core.rb, app/options.rb, bin/rbdbgr, lib/rbdbgr.rb,
	test/unit/test-app-options.rb: Add first rbdbgr option --chdir. Fix

	* Rakefile, lib/rbdbgr.rb, processor/main.rb: Rakefile: add install
	and install_full tasks lib/rbdbgr.rb: add debug_str. Works but is
	not complete though, still need "set substitute string"
	processor/main.rb; start mechanism for an intial profile or command
	array. Not finished.

2010-03-01  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* Rakefile: Administrivia

2010-02-28  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	descriptors  More and better unit tests.

2009-09-23  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* io/input.rb, test/unit/test-io-input.rb: :line_edit only works if

2009-09-23  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* interface/script.rb, interface/user.rb, io/input.rb,
	io/string_array.rb, processor/main.rb, test/unit/test-user.rb: Hook
	user/script interfaces to use new IO-based io/input. string_array

	not the interface.

2009-09-23  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

2009-09-22  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* processor/command/irb.rb, processor/running.rb: irb interrupt

2009-09-22  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	processor/command/irb.rb, processor/command/up.rb,
	processor/command/where.rb, processor/frame.rb, processor/main.rb,

	commands. "last position" includes the stack size. frame_setup() can
	figure out the thread, so no need to pass that.

2009-09-21  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/set_subcmd/events.rb, processor/main.rb,
	processor/msg.rb: Correct process_command_and_quit? to do the right
	thing on interface EOF.  Also, it now understands comments and how
	to repeat the last command on the empty string.  This removes bugs
	in stepping on a "source" command and the duplicate stepping when
	leaving irb.  events.rb: allow commas to end event names, i.e.   set
	events line, call, return as well as:   set events line call return


2009-09-21  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* irbrc, lib/irb.rb: Chain in user irbrc if the RBDBGR_IRB
	environment variable is set.

2009-09-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/irb.rb, processor/command/irb.rb: Wasn't getting irbrc path

	processor/command/step.rb, processor/default.rb, processor/main.rb,
	processor/mock.rb, processor/running.rb, rbdbgr.rb: Add custom irb
	profile for rbdbgr irb sessions. Running processor/command/irb.rb
	now runs irb which can be used to test the custom profile. Added irb
	command 'n' for next.  DRY step/next suffix detection code.  Set
	defaults more for normal users:   set autoeval on   set events:
	remove instruction stepping   set different on  Did I mention that
	"next" now works?

2009-09-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/next.rb: Add debugger "next" command. That
	wasn't so bad was it? Need unit/integration tests of this stuff.

2009-09-19  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* interface/base_intf.rb, interface/script.rb, interface/user.rb,
	processor/main.rb, processor/msg.rb: More complete I/O used
	interface routines. Interfaces now stack. "source" command works
	modulo one glitch. Fix bug in setting @output.

2009-09-19  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/base_cmd.rb, processor/command/source.rb,
	processor/command/step.rb, processor/main.rb, processor/mock.rb,
	processor/msg.rb, rbdbgr.rb: Pretty close to having a working

2009-08-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>
