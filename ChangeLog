	* processor/breakpoint.rb, processor/eval.rb,
	processor/validate.rb, test/unit/test-cmd-break.rb: We now scan
	parent instruction sequences to find breakpoint line numbers.  Note:
	this requires an updated rb-threadframe from git.  For example, suppose the code is:   xx = 'break here'   1.times do      debugger_is_here   end If you are at the line of "debugger_is_here", the xx line is not
	part of that instruction sequence, but can be found by searching its

	breakpoint.rb Breakpoint -> Trepanning::Breakpoint. Look also for
	activity in the future also in rbx-trepanning.

	* processor/command/set_subcmd/max_subcmd/list.rb,

	interface/user.rb, app/core.rb: move finalize from user to Debugger
	where we can make sure we've turned of tracing beforehand.  validate: we are getting into a recursive trace when removing
	debugger iseqs. Omit until we figure out a better fix.  app/file.rb: guard against adding to ISEQ__ hash while enumerating
	over it.

	("set trace buffer on/off")

2010-03-31  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/set_subcmd/.gitignore,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/substitute.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/trace.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/trace_subcmd/var.rb,

	"set trace buffer").

2010-03-31  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/set_subcmd/debug_subcmd/dbgr.rb,
	processor/location.rb: Small changes like longer help for "set debug
	dbgr"

2010-03-31  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/core.rb: Bug created by last commit in moving code around.
	Should'a check the functional tests...

2010-03-25  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/eventbuffer.rb: evetbuffer.rb moved to trace package.

2010-03-25  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/eventbuffer.rb: Changes before removal

2010-03-25  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/eventbuffer.rb: Fill out eventbuffer more.

2010-03-24  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	capturing.

2010-03-23  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/list.rb, processor/location.rb: Fix bug in
	listing remapped eval strings in C functions.

2010-03-23  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/list.rb, processor/command/where.rb,
	processor/location.rb, test/functional/test-return.rb: list.rb:
	respect reload_on_change location.rb: use C class name hack (from
	hook arg) like we do in "where".

2010-03-23  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/frame.rb: Make use of cached iseq's via the SHA1 for the
	iseq.

2010-03-23  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/rbdbgr.rb, processor/command/set_subcmd/debug_subcmd/dbgr.rb,
	processor/location.rb: location.rb: small bug in "via" location line
	number reporting dbgr.rb: more facility for debugging the debugger

2010-03-22  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/location.rb, test/functional/test-finish.rb,
	test/functional/test-return.rb, test/functional/test-step.rb: 
	Distinguish return values from functions 'r=>' from return values
	from debugger evaluated expressions 'R=>'.

2010-03-21  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/command/info_subcmd/return.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/return.rb, processor/location.rb,
	test/functional/test-raise.rb, test/functional/test-return.rb,
	test/unit/test-app-frame.rb: Some support for showing and changing C
	return values.

2010-03-21  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/info_subcmd/registers.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/sp.rb: registers.rb: better message

2010-03-21  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* interface/script.rb, processor/command/help.rb,
	processor/default.rb, processor/main.rb: Some small script (debugger
	"source" command) fixes.  script.rb: Don't show debugger output if
	running a script.  main.rb; Slightly better handling of blank
	command lines help.rb: don't show aliases for a commmand where help
	on subcommands were asked for.

2010-03-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/Makefile, processor/main.rb,
	test/unit/test-proc-main.rb: If a debugger command starts with !,
	for evaluation. For example s=1 would be taken as a "step" command,
	but !s=1 is an assignement to s. The leading ! is removed.

2010-03-19  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/debug.rb, processor/command/raise.rb,
	test/functional/test-raise.rb: Some "raise" command bug fixes. Some
	"debug" (recursive debug) fixes.

2010-03-19  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/core.rb: Traceback for "raise" command has less noise by
	pushing raise into the trace filter.

2010-03-16  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/core.rb, processor/command/raise.rb, processor/main.rb,
	test/functional/fn_helper.rb: More work on 'raise' command. Warning:
	there is a bug in my Ruby 1.9 that prevents tracing from working
	after "raise" is issued.

2010-03-16  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/core.rb, processor/command/info_subcmd/program.rb,
	processor/command/raise.rb, processor/location.rb,
	processor/main.rb, test/functional/fn_helper.rb,
	test/functional/test-delete.rb, test/functional/test-finish.rb,
	test/functional/test-step.rb: New 'raise' command which raises an
	exception in the debugged program.  The debugged-program's return values are now prefaced with R=>
	rather than =>. Hopefully this makes things clearer while still
	somewhat intuitive.

2010-03-14  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/step.rb, processor/running.rb,
	test/functional/test-next.rb: Fix a couple of small stepping bugs.

	event.

2010-03-14  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	test/functional/test-finish.rb, test/functional/test-next.rb,
	test/functional/test-step.rb, test/functional/test-trace-var.rb: 
	Show exception object when we have 'raise' event.  location output
	has changed from prior commit. Track in test cases.  Show exception
	object on 'raise' exception.

2010-03-13  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/command/info_subcmd/program.rb,
	processor/hook.rb, processor/location.rb, processor/main.rb: Show
	more information in location.  If a call, the method name and params
	If a return the return value.

2010-03-13  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/default.rb, lib/rbdbgr.rb: Now that we have a patch for
	ruby-1.9 to fix SEGV's in eval, debug_str works. Some minor tweaks.

2010-03-13  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/irb.rb, data/irbrc, processor/command/irb.rb: irb.rb:
	Syncronize IRB's BACK_TRACE_LIMIT with the debugger's.  irbrc:
	"file" for eval shouldn't contain ":" since that causes IRB to think
	to traceback are IRB bugs.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* data/irbrc: A better irb monkeypatch

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/file.rb, app/frame.rb, processor/breakpoint.rb,
	processor/command/where.rb, processor/validate.rb,
	test/unit/test-cmd-break.rb: Start to fill out breakpoints more.
	Some bugs fixed, many other roam freely.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/command/set_subcmd/btlimit.rb,
	processor/command/show_subcmd/btlimit.rb,
	processor/command/where.rb, processor/default.rb: Add set/show
	btlimit: a way to set backtrace_levels (irb's BACK_TRACE_LEVELS)

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README.textile: Minor

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/rbdbgr.rb: Add :hide_stack as an option to Debugger.debug

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/rbdbgr.rb: Debugger.debug/ger fixes: don't show stack frame
	levels below debugger method -- unless requested via :debugstack.
	Fix wrong method name.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* data/irbrc: Missed one

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* data/irbrc, processor/command/irb.rb: Regularize $rbdgr_ names in
	irb -d

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/irb.rb, app/mock.rb, processor/command/irb.rb: Less use of
	global variable $rbdbgr. Have to back off the way step/next do their
	thing. Document added irb command 'dbgr'.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/irb.rb, data/irbrc, processor/command/irb.rb,
	processor/main.rb: Add command inside irb: dbgr to issue debugger
	statements.  Dry irb code a little.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/irb.rb, data/irbrc, processor/command/irb.rb: Start to get
	more info back from extend irb commands.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/core.rb, app/frame.rb, lib/rbdbgr.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/trace.rb, processor/command/where.rb,
	processor/main.rb, test/functional/test-trace-var.rb: Add a
	trace_var hook and "set trace var" command.

2010-03-11  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README.textile, app/default.rb, app/frame.rb, lib/rbdbgr.rb,
	processor/command/where.rb, test/unit/test-app-frame.rb: frame.rb,
	where.rb: handle showing basename in files. Simplify interface
	README.textile: things have changed slightly

2010-03-10  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* Rakefile: Add sudo to install when necessary

2010-03-10  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/location.rb: I'm guessing/hoping this is
	more-useful in reporting the debugger location (method
	print_location) for eval strings.

2010-03-10  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/debug.rb, processor/frame.rb: Cooler and more
	robust kind of fix to hidelevels bug.

2010-03-10  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/debug.rb: Deal thread appearing for the first
	time.

2010-03-10  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/down.rb, processor/command/info_subcmd/iseq.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/debug_subcmd/stack.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/substitute_subcmd/eval.rb,
	processor/command/up.rb, processor/frame.rb,
	test/unit/test-proc-frame.rb: frame.rb, iseq.rb: use/show SHA1's for
	instruction sequences.  {up,down,frame,eval,stack}.rb: DRY code.
	eval.rb, frame.rb: allow a frame parameter to eval.

2010-03-09  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb, processor/command/list.rb,
	processor/command/set_subcmd/substitute_subcmd/eval.rb,
	processor/frame.rb, processor/location.rb, processor/main.rb: 
	Automatic eval string remapping to a file in "list" stack and
	location listings. Manual remapping too via "set substitute eval".  Todo possibly remove set substitute eval or change it to take a
	frame #. Work in rb-threadframe to get sha1/checksum of iseq instead
	of inspect name.

2010-03-09  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/rbdbgr.rb: Don't run .rbdbgrc or any startup file twice.

2010-03-09  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/print.rb, processor/eval.rb, processor/main.rb,
	test/functional/test-delete.rb, test/functional/test-finish.rb,
	test/functional/test-step.rb: main.rb: auto-eval output looks more
	like irb using inspect and prefaced with => print.rb: Add print
	command which uses safe-repr for output.  eaval.rb: add a kind of
	eval that field hide exceptions.

2010-03-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* interface/script.rb: Small bug in script handling

2010-03-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/eval.rb, test/unit/test-proc-eval.rb: Dummy up the eval
	"filename" to something a little more informative. Eventually this
	might be pushed back into Ruby.  Start unit test for eval code.

2010-03-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* Rakefile, app/options.rb, lib/rbdbgr.rb, test/data/.gitignore,
	test/data/quit.cmd, test/data/quit.right, test/example/null.rb,
	test/integration/helper.rb, test/integration/test-quit.rb: First
	integration test - yay! options.rb: don't try to load a command file
	that isn't readable rbdbgr.rb: fix bugs in command-file handling
	integration/helper.rb Rakefile: add integration targets

2010-03-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* test/functional/fn_helper.rb, test/unit/cmd-helper.rb: tests
	should to add :nx => true now.

2010-03-08  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/default.rb, app/options.rb, bin/rbdbgr, lib/rbdbgr.rb,
	test/unit/test-app-options.rb: Add --nx and @settings[:nx] options.

2010-03-08  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* interface/script.rb, lib/rbdbgr.rb: rbdbgr.rb: Bug: --command used
	           wrong interface. singleton methods debug and debug_str: pass options
	to Debugger.new. Set different off on debug_s           tr by
	default

2010-03-07  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* bin/rbdbgr, lib/rbdbgr.rb: --command option and
	@settings[:command] now does something. More work need to silence
	script interface output.

2010-03-07  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* app/default.rb, app/options.rb, bin/rbdbgr, lib/rbdbgr.rb,
	test/unit/test-app-options.rb: Start --command option. Not fully
	done yet.  options.rb: Fix bug in show_version().  setup_options(): make more
	functional in handling of --help and --version.  lib/rbdbgr.rb: setup options in a way that won't mess up
	DEFAULT_CMDLINE_SETTINGS. Accumulate startup-files for --command
	option.

2010-03-06  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* processor/command/debug.rb: deubg.rb: works better now. Not ideal,
	but much better.

	Save/restore hidelevel and frame.

2010-03-04  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	recursive debug message. pdb/pydb does that

2010-03-04  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/eval.rb: Split off evaluation routines from main.rb

2010-03-04  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/mock.rb, processor/command/debug.rb, processor/mock.rb: Add
	"debug" recursive debugging. Some of the underlying mechanism
	currently bleeds through. But better than nothing.

2010-03-03  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/core.rb, app/options.rb, bin/rbdbgr, lib/rbdbgr.rb,
	test/unit/test-app-options.rb: Add first rbdbgr option --chdir. Fix
	bugs in handling that.  app/core.rb DEFAULT_SETTINGS ->
	CORE_DEFAULT_SETTINGS to avoid constant name clashes.

2010-03-01  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* Rakefile, lib/rbdbgr.rb, processor/main.rb: Rakefile: add install
	and install_full tasks lib/rbdbgr.rb: add debug_str. Works but is
	not complete though, still need "set substitute string"
	processor/main.rb; start mechanism for an intial profile or command
	array. Not finished.

2010-03-01  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* Rakefile: Administrivia

2010-02-28  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/info_subcmd/args.rb,

	* README.textile: Small doc changes

2010-02-28  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README.textile: Start to describe the arduous process of
	installing.

2010-02-27  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README.textile: More text futzing

2010-02-27  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* Rakefile: Administrivia

2010-02-27  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README.textile: One more. (I really should figure out how to
	preview textile by installing locally.)

2010-02-27  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README.textile: Add a lead space in 1st line in example code.

2010-02-27  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README, README.textile, Rakefile: Try *textile*. Thanks priteau!

2010-02-27  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README, README.md: Nope. Don't have the markdown magic.

2010-02-27  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README, README.md, Rakefile: Let's give markdown another chance.

2010-02-27  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* Rakefile, app/frame.rb, app/irb.rb, app/util.rb, data/irbrc,

	processor/command/show_subcmd/auto.rb,
	processor/command/show_subcmd/debug.rb, profile/irbrc,
	test/unit/test-app-util.rb: Lots of bug fixes and goodness.
	app/frame.rb: was listing C params in reverse order. safe_repr each
	              arg was adding a non-existent optional argument info_subcmd/args.rb:
	                     Fix buggy test for whether params may have changed.  Also fix wrong
	C param order.  Rakefile: forgot to add data directory to
	distribution profile/irbrc -> data/irbrc, app/irb.rb: consolidate
	files into one directory. Data wins app/util.rb: safe_repr now
	matches quotes and can be told what suffix (...) to use rbdbgr.rb:
	don't debug inside in debug.

2010-02-26  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/info_subcmd/args.rb: info args for non C stack
	should show all parameters. Some bugs fixed.

	More piddling around with debugger options

2010-02-26  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/options.rb: Start options processing. Used in integration
	testing.

2010-02-26  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* test/unit/test-proc-validate.rb: "Step to" sort of works. More is
	needed in determining whether something is a method, when two are
	equal, and removing the SEGV's when call C-call/return events are
	handled by default. But other than that - perfect!

2010-02-26  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/frame.rb: Fix bug in retrieving C function argument values.

2010-02-26  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	processor/frame.rb, processor/msg.rb, test/unit/test-app-file.rb,
	test/unit/test-app-util.rb: app/frame.rb: better parameter display
	for C frames app/util.rb: add safe_repr helper.rb: sp adjustment for
	C frames processor/frame.rb: allow setting frame to hidden stack
	entries on request unit/test-app-file.rb: cut-and-paste error.

2010-02-23  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* test/example/gcd.rb, test/example/gcd1.rb,
	test/integration/.gitignore, test/integration/helper.rb: Lame start
	at integration tests.

2010-02-23  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/core.rb: Somewhere inside the VM we allow I guess nested
	tracing which is messing up ThreadFrame pointers and information.
	When this is fixed we can do the below.  Until then we need to at
	least remove C calls and returns and possibly other events as well.

2010-02-23  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* app/file.rb, processor/command/info_subcmd/break.rb,

	test/functional/test-delete.rb, test/unit/cmd-helper.rb,
	test/unit/test-cmd-break.rb: sp.rb: Add ability to change VM stack
	entries.  frame.rb: Fix bug which was messing up class values inside
	C functions breakpoint.rb: make message look more like gdb Remove
	some Ruby warning messages.  main.rb: remove duplicate
	load_debugger_commands method

2010-02-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/undisplay.rb: Add undisplay command

	* processor/command/set_subcmd/events.rb, processor/main.rb,
	processor/msg.rb: Correct process_command_and_quit? to do the right

	profile for rbdbgr irb sessions. Running processor/command/irb.rb
	now runs irb which can be used to test the custom profile. Added irb
	command 'n' for next.  DRY step/next suffix detection code.  Set defaults more for normal users:   set autoeval on   set events: remove instruction stepping   set different on Did I mention that "next" now works?

2009-09-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* processor/command/next.rb: Add debugger "next" command. That

	feeling I will be using this a lot.  Rakefile: start work to make a
	gem. Doesn't work yet though.

2009-08-26  rockyb <rocky@gnu.org>

	that we split the window.

2009-08-26  rockyb <rocky@gnu.org>

	* emacs/rbdbg-track.el: Add rbdbg-trace-mode and install a
	comint-output-filter-function hook. And with this, Yay! we have
	something minimally tracking locations for rbdbgr.rb.

2009-08-26  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* emacs/rbdbg-file.el, emacs/rbdbg-loc.el, emacs/rbdbg-lochist.el,
	emacs/rbdbg-track.el, emacs/test/test-loc.el: Pretty much a working
	comint hook. I can't believe how something this simple was made so
	complicated.  And we don't need no stinking buffer in a location object - An Emacs
	mark contains a reference to a buffer.

2009-08-25  rockyb <rocky@gnu.org>

	* emacs/rbdbg-loc.el, emacs/test/test-loc.el: Add routine to go to a

	code into mock.rb More demoing done added through the advanced magic
	of loops.

	message for being in C functions.  main.rb: add more even icons and
	show even when we don't have an icon.

2009-08-21  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

2009-08-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/core.rb, rbdbgr.rb: More work to make stepping work. There is
	still weirdness going on. Also it looks like resolution on what's up
	with event tracing thing is going to be crucial.

2009-08-19  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/core.rb, rbdbgr.rb: Add event after debugger-call debugging.
	Don't show stopping points inside debugger method for when
	:immediate => true It's almost looking like a real debugger.

	processor/command/show_subcmd/traceset.rb, processor/main.rb: First
	cut at a 'step' command. Better 'continue' command. Event masks now
	saved in lib/core.rb where this kind of stuff should be. Remove
	bogosity of returning a value to break out of the command loop - I'm
	not even sure why I even let it exist this long.

	have needed class contants. Allow commands/subcommands to get at
	core and the trace filter. Add run_show_val for generic command
	value display.

	Nuke trace hook until I figure out the garbage collection segv. I'll

2009-08-17  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>
